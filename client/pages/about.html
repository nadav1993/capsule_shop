				A single-serve coffee container is a method for coffee brewing that prepares only enough coffee for a single portion.
				Single-serve coffee containers can both reduce the time needed to brew coffee and simplify the brewing process by eliminating 
				the need to measure out portions, flavorings, and additives from large bulk containers. They can also help to keep the unused 
				product fresher by individually packaging portions separately without exposing the entire supply batch to air and light. 
				Paper coffee pods can be functionally identical to plastic and metal coffee capsules, if the paper pods are individually sealed in separate bags.
				<br><span class="capsuleCategory">Nespresso:</span> Nestlé Nespresso S.A., trading as Nespresso, is an operating unit of the Nestlé Group, based 
				in Lausanne, Switzerland. Nespresso machines brew espresso and coffee from coffee capsules, or pods in machines for home or professional use, 
				a type of pre-apportioned single-use container of ground coffee beans, sometimes with added flavorings. Once inserted into a machine, the capsules 
				are pierced and processed, water is then forced against a heating element at high pressure meaning that only the quantity for a single cup is warmed. 
				Nespresso is a premium price coffee, and by 2011 had annual sales in excess of 3 billion Swiss francs. The word Nespresso is a portmanteau of Nestlé and 
				Espresso, a common mechanic used across other Nestlé brands (Nescafé, BabyNes, Nesquik).
				All Nespresso coffee is roasted, ground and encapsulated in one of 3 factories in Switzerland (Avenches, Orbe & Romont), but the company sells its system 
				of machines and capsules worldwide, as well as the VertuoLine system in North America and certain other countries.
				<br><span class="capsuleCategory">Nescaffe:</span> Nestlé began developing a coffee brand in 1930, at the initiative of the Brazilian government, to help 
				to preserve the substantial surplus of the annual Brazilian coffee harvest. Max Morgenthaler led the development project. Nestlé introduced the new product 
				under the brand name "Nescafé" on 1 April 1938. Nescafé is a soluble powdered coffee that became an American staple during World War II.
				In 1965, Nestlé introduced a freeze-dried coffee brand called "Nescafé Gold" in Europe.
				In 1966, Nestlé developped a freeze-dried coffee brand under the name Taster's Choice
				<br><span class="capsuleCategory">Seattle Coffee Gear:</span> Seattle Coffee Gear is the answer to a very specific question: How can I make an excellent cup of coffee at home?
				Unfortunately, we're probably all too familiar with the bitter and diluted 'coffee water' -- you know, the kind of drip coffee you'd find in a roadside diner. If that's all coffee 
				could be, we wouldn't be here! In fact, the quest to find out how to make delicious home espresso led our founder, Victor, on a journey through trial and error, wasting money on machines 
				that didn't fit his needs and getting frustrated by the lack of practical information available. When he eventually found the perfect machine, he became convinced there had to be a 
				better way to get from 'coffee water' to espresso.
				So he took his experience and turned it into a business: The kind of company that provides skilled, knowledgeable advice on everything from the best machine to 
				meet your needs to how you can make that delicious espresso on your own. Armed with the singular mission to provide unbiased and customer-centric service by a crew 
				who love what they do, Seattle Coffee Gear has grown from Victor's great idea into a unique and innovative leader in home espresso machines.
